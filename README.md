This is a repo just for the RE seminar - the install script will install 
(heh) everything you need.

Important Notes:

You MUST use Ubuntu 16.04 for this script to work. 
Kali Linux will NOT work.

Instructions:
The one liner to use to install is:

git clone https://github.com/raildex1/re_demo_setup && 
bash re_demo_setup/re_demo_setup.sh

Or if you already cloned the repo and are in the re_demo_setup 
directory:

bash re_demo_setup.sh
